This code is a simple Petrol On-Demand web app prototype built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The UI is styled with gradients and card-like components to make it look like a mobile app. It allows a user to enter their location, select the required petrol quantity (in litres) from a dropdown, and then place an order with the “Order Petrol” button. When the button is clicked, JavaScript checks if the location field is filled, then generates a random Order ID, and displays an order confirmation card showing the entered details along with a delivery status message. Although this is only a front-end demo (no backend or real delivery integration), it simulates how an on-demand petrol ordering app could look and function.
